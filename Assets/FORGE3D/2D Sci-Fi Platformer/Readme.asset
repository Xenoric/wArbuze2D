      for this project to run. The required project settings should be configured
      automatically during the asset store import process.You can always import them
      manually from ProjectSettings.zip located in the root folder of the asset.
      It is also recommended making a clean project upon asset import to avoid any
      problems with overwriting your existing project settings files.
